# Tic Tac Toe Mod 1 Final Project

### `Abstract:`
This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game in a snow sports themed web application where two players play the game by alternating clicking tiles to take their turn. The score is recorded when a player wins the game which is then retianed in local storage and the losing player goes first on the next game. A draw game result will allow the player go first on the next game who did not start the current game.


### `Installation Instructions:`
1. [Click To Open Repo](https://github.com/RickV85/Tic_Tac_Toe_Mod_1_Final_Project)
2. Click the "Fork" button. (This will create a user copy of the repository.)
3. Open the Terminal application.
4. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate to where the local repository will live.
5. In GitHub, click on the green "Code" dropdown.
6. User will see three clone options. Select "SSH".
7. Copy the SSH key.
8. In Terminal, run "git clone [insert copied SSH key here]".
9. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate into the newly created directory.

### `Context:`
This project was required to be built ground up in seven days with five required files. The game.js and player.js files were required to create and handle all data model updates with their methods. The main.js file was required to manipulate the DOM from the data model. The index.html and styles.css render content and style the DOM.

### `Learning Goals:`
1. Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of DRY JavaScript and event delegation to handle similar event listeners.
2. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
4. Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### `Technology Used:`
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this application was written in VS Code and pushed into GitHub. 

### `Wins`
I am the most proud of successfully implementing the suggested localStorage extension and my personal extension that allows the user to clear each player's score and the localStorage to start over. I also feel great about the "Tic Tac Snow" theme I came up with to provide a more engaging UX.

### `Future Additions`
I would like to add a start screen allowing the users to enter their own name so that they are not just "Player 1" and "Player 2". I would have liked to add even more to the UX with sounds and animations since Tic Tac Toe is not the most exciting game. The last addition I wanted to create was a more responsive experience for different screen widths including mobile resolutions.
